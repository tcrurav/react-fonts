## Include a font in your React Project

Follow the instructions in the site of your chosen font. In my case the instructions are here: https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/f323892ea5283141dbbbec176c9e3ee7

1. Step 1: copy the link line in your index.html in your react project:
```
<link href="https://db.onlinewebfonts.com/c/f323892ea5283141dbbbec176c9e3ee7?family=Antique+Olive+Nord+Italic" rel="stylesheet">
```

2. Step 2: I have used the font in Home.css like this:
```
p {
  font-family: "Antique Olive Nord Italic";
}
```
